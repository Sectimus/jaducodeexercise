# Day 1
+ Created intitial repository with the remote managed by GitHub.
+ Migrated the provided documentation to be visually represented in the [README.md](/README.md) file.
+ Installed PHP `8.3` on development machine as per Symfony documentation.
+ Installed Composer `2.7.2` on development machine as per Symfony documentation.
+ Installed Symfony CLI `5.8.15` on development machine as optionally recommended by the Symfony documentation.
+ Used the Symfony CLI to initiate the project. I have opted to initate using the webapp version instead of the skeleton version to include a GUI through selfhosted infrastructure.
+ Additionally I have decided to build this project as a docker image that can be run for a more straightforward review.
