## The brief
We would like you to write a small PHP application, utilising the Symfony Framework, to
implement the following operations as outlined within the [CheckerInterface.php](https://gist.github.com/dgudgeon/7198459ee90abdddc13231e8b5e064bb) file:
|                Method                |                                                                                           Description                                                                                           |
|:------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `isPalindrome($word)`                | Check the parameter `$word` and return `true` if it is a palindrome.</br>Example:</br>“anna” should return `true`</br>“Bark” should return `false`                                              |
| `isAnagram($word, $comparison)`      | Check the parameter `$word` and return `true` if it is an anagram of `$comparison`.</br>Example:</br>“coalface, cacao elf” should return `true`</br>“coalface, dark elf” should return `false`  |
| `isPangram($phrase)`                 | Example:</br>“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” should return `true`</br>“The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster.” should return `false` |

*You can feel free to add any additional creative flair to your solution as you see fit, however
we will be judging primarily on the quality of the above implementation rather than extra
features that you choose to implement.*

**Your submission will be scored based on:**
1. Functionality
2. Code / solution design
3. Testing approach and coverage
4. Supporting documentation

## Submission
Please create and share a GitHub repository containing your completed solution with us.
At a minimum, please provide the following within your submission:
+ `instructions.md` - any instructions / requirements that we might need to run your application should this be relevant
+ `time.md` - tell us how your time broke down throughout the tasks in this exercise
+ All files required by your application to work
+ Any other supporting files / documents used by you during the completion of this exercise
